# 2. Layouts Overview

PyQt6 provides several layout managers that automatically arrange widgets within windows, ensuring your GUI adapts well
to resizing and different screen sizes. Hereâ€™s an overview of the main layouts available:

## 1. QVBoxLayout

- Arranges widgets vertically, from top to bottom.
- Each widget is placed below the previous one.
- Commonly used for stacking elements in a column.
- Example: A settings panel with labels and input fields stacked vertically[1][2][5][6].

## 2. QHBoxLayout

- Arranges widgets horizontally, from left to right.
- Each widget is placed to the right of the previous one.
- Useful for toolbars, button rows, or any horizontal grouping[1][2][3][5][6].

## 3. QGridLayout

- Arranges widgets in a two-dimensional grid (rows and columns).
- Widgets can span multiple rows or columns.
- Ideal for forms, calculators, or any layout requiring tabular alignment[1][2][5][6].

## 4. QFormLayout

- Specifically designed for forms: pairs labels and fields in two columns.
- Left column: labels; right column: input widgets (e.g., text fields, combo boxes).
- Simpler and more readable than QGridLayout when you only need two columns[4][6][7].

## 5. QStackedLayout

- Stacks widgets on top of each other; only one widget is visible at a time.
- Useful for implementing tabbed interfaces or wizards where you switch between different views[1].

## 6. QSplitter

- Not a layout, but a container widget that arranges child widgets horizontally or vertically with adjustable dividers.
- Allows the user to resize panels interactively[4].

## Summary Table

| Layout         | Arrangement                     | Typical Use Case                        |
|----------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| QVBoxLayout    | Vertical (top-down)             | Stacked widgets, forms, settings panels |
| QHBoxLayout    | Horizontal (left-right)         | Toolbars, button rows                   |
| QGridLayout    | Grid (rows/columns)             | Calculators, complex forms              |
| QFormLayout    | Label-field pairs               | Data entry forms                        |
| QStackedLayout | Stacked (one visible at a time) | Wizards, tabbed interfaces              |
| QSplitter      | Resizable panels                | Split views (file explorers, editors)   |

## Nesting Layouts

You can nest layouts inside each other to create complex, responsive interfaces. For example, a horizontal layout might
contain several vertical layouts, each managing a column of widgets[1][2].

## Choosing a Layout

- Use **QVBoxLayout** or **QHBoxLayout** for simple linear arrangements.
- Use **QGridLayout** for tabular or matrix-like layouts.
- Use **QFormLayout** for clean, two-column forms.
- Use **QStackedLayout** when you need to swap between multiple views in the same space.
- Use **QSplitter** for resizable panels.

These layout managers ensure your application looks professional and adapts gracefully to window resizing[6][7].
