# 1. Overview

Here’s a step-by-step guide to get you started with Qt Designer and then use your designed interface in a PyQt6
application.

## **1. Introduction to Qt Designer: Best Tutorials**

**Text Tutorials:**

- The official [Qt documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/designer-quick-start.html) provides a concise and clear quick
  start guide to Qt Designer, outlining the main steps:
  choosing your form, placing widgets, arranging them in layouts, connecting signals and slots, and previewing the form.
  This is a great place to get oriented with the tool’s interface and workflow[1].
- The Python GUIs website offers a beginner-friendly tutorial specifically for PyQt6, guiding you through installing Qt
  Designer, launching it, and creating a simple UI using the drag-and-drop
  editor[[4](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/pyqt6-first-steps-qt-designer/)][[13](https://www.pythontutorial.net/pyqt/qt-designer/)].
  It also explains the difference between saving `.ui` files and converting them to Python code.
- Real Python has a comprehensive step-by-step guide to using Qt Designer with Python, covering the basics and practical
  tips for efficient GUI design[8].

**Video Tutorials:**

- [QtDesigner QuickStart (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1GJqHPd3Lk): A short, focused video that
  demonstrates creating your first `.ui` file and explains the basics of the Qt Designer interface[2].
- [Everything about using Qt Designer! | PyQt6 Tutorial Part 4 (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EjrLpC4cE4):
  This video covers installation, creating layouts, adding widgets, and converting `.ui` files for use in PyQt6. It’s
  especially helpful for students using Python 3.10+ or those needing help with installation quirks[7].
- [Download and create an app using Qt Designer (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HgIAZyrqgU): A practical
  walkthrough on downloading, installing, and starting your first project with Qt Designer for PyQt6[9].

## **2. Using Qt Designer Interfaces in PyQt6 Applications**

Once you’ve designed your UI and saved it as a `.ui` file, you have two main options to use it in your PyQt6
application:

### **A. Load the `.ui` File Directly at Runtime**

This is the quickest way to get started. You use the `uic` module from PyQt6 to load the `.ui` file:

```python
import sys
from PyQt6 import QtWidgets, uic

app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)
window = uic.loadUi("your_form.ui")
window.show()
app.exec()
```

This method is great for prototyping, but you can’t easily subclass or add custom logic in the constructor[4][11].

### **B. Convert the `.ui` File to Python Code**

For more complex applications, convert the `.ui` file to a Python module using the `pyuic6` tool:

```shell
pyuic6 -o your_form.py your_form.ui
```

Then, you can subclass and add your logic:

```python
import sys
from PyQt6.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow
from your_form import Ui_MainWindow  # This class is generated by pyuic6


class MainWindow(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.ui = Ui_MainWindow()
        self.ui.setupUi(self)
        # Add your custom logic here


app = QApplication(sys.argv)
window = MainWindow()
window.show()
app.exec()
```

This approach lets you keep your UI and logic separate and is recommended for most real applications[4][7][13].

**Further Reading and Examples:**

- The Python GUIs tutorial walks through both approaches with code samples and explanations[4].
- The PyQt6 tutorial on PythonTutorial.net provides a detailed example of designing a login form in Qt Designer and then
  using it in Python, both by loading the `.ui` file directly and by converting it to Python code[13].
- The YouTube video "PyQt6 QtDesigner .ui files" demonstrates both loading and converting `.ui` files in PyQt6[11].

**Recommended learning path:**

1. Watch a short video or read the official quick start to get familiar with Qt Designer’s interface[1][2].
2. Follow a beginner tutorial to create a simple UI (like a login form), save it as a `.ui` file, and preview it[4][13].
3. Try both methods for using the UI in Python: loading the `.ui` file directly and converting it to Python
   code[4][7][13].
4. Explore more advanced examples as you get comfortable.
