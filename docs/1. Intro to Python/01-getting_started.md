# Getting Started

## Installing Python

To get started with Python, you'll need to install it on your system. Here's how to do it on different platforms:

### Windows

1. Visit [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version for Windows.
2. Run the installer and make sure to check "Add Python to PATH"[1].
3. Follow the installation wizard to complete the process.

### macOS

1. Go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the macOS installer.
2. Open the .pkg file and follow the installation instructions[2].
3. Python will be installed in the Applications folder.

### Linux

Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. If not:

1. Use your distribution's package manager (e.g., apt for Ubuntu)[3].
2. For example, on Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install python3`

## Installing JetBrains Toolbox and PyCharm Professional

### JetBrains Toolbox

1. Visit the JetBrains Toolbox App web page and download the appropriate version for your OS[4].
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. Once installed, launch the Toolbox App.

### Getting an Education License

1. Go to the JetBrains website and apply for a [free educational license](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/)[5].
2. Verify your student or teacher status with your academic email.
3. Once approved, you'll receive instructions to activate your license.

### Installing PyCharm Professional

1. Open JetBrains Toolbox.
2. Search for "PyCharm" and select "PyCharm Professional"[4].
3. Click the "Install" button next to PyCharm Professional.
4. The Toolbox App will download and install PyCharm automatically.

## Creating a New Pure Python Project

1. Launch PyCharm Professional.
2. Click "New Project" on the welcome screen or go to `File > New Project`.
3. In the New Project dialog:
    - Specify the project location.
    - Select "Create Git repository" if desired.
    - Check "Create a main.py welcome script"[6].
4. Choose your Python interpreter or create a new virtual environment.
5. Click "Create" to set up your new project.

## Running the Welcome Script

1. In the project explorer, locate the `main.py` file.
2. Right-click on `main.py` and select "Run 'main'"[10].
3. Alternatively, click the green play button next to the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block[10].
4. The script will execute, and you'll see the output in the Run tool window.

## Hello, World!

```python
# This is a sample Python script.

# Press Maj+F10 to execute it or replace it with your code.
# Press Double Shift to search everywhere for classes, files, tool windows, actions, and settings.


def print_hi(name):
    # Use a breakpoint in the code line below to debug your script.
    print(f'Hi, {name}')  # Press Ctrl+F8 to toggle the breakpoint.


# Press the green button in the gutter to run the script.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print_hi('PyCharm')

# See PyCharm help at https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/
```

The default script generated by PyCharm is a simple "Hello, World!" style program with some additional comments explaining PyCharm features. Let's break it down:

## Script Structure

### Function Definition

```python
def print_hi(name):
    print(f'Hi, {name}')
```

This defines a function called `print_hi` that takes a `name` parameter. It uses an f-string to print a greeting with the provided name[2].

### Main Block

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print_hi('PyCharm')
```

This is the main block of the script. It checks if the script is being run directly (not imported as a module) and calls the `print_hi` function with 'PyCharm' as the argument[4].

## PyCharm Features

The script includes comments highlighting some PyCharm features:

1. **Execution shortcut**: "Press Maj+F10 to execute it or replace it with your code."
2. **Search functionality**: "Press Double Shift to search everywhere for classes, files, tool windows, actions, and settings."
3. **Debugging**: "Use a breakpoint in the code line below to debug your script." and "Press Ctrl+F8 to toggle the breakpoint."
4. **Run button**: "Press the green button in the gutter to run the script."

These comments serve as quick reminders for new users about PyCharm's key features[1][3].

## Purpose

This default script serves several purposes:

1. It provides a working example of a simple Python program.
2. It demonstrates basic Python syntax, including function definition and the main block.
3. It introduces users to PyCharm-specific features and shortcuts.
4. It gives new users a starting point for their own projects.

By running this script, you should see the output: "Hi, PyCharm" in the console[6][15].
