specifically designed for Java developers transitioning to Python OOP (1h7m)[1]

- **[Python Crash Course for Java Developers](https://github.com/blu3r4y/python-for-java-developers)** - GitHub
  repository by blu3r4y with interactive Jupyter notebooks and
  slides specifically for Java developers[3]

#### OOP-Focused Resources

- **[Python OOP Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeznW_7DlB0)** by Tech With Tim - YouTube video series
  covering everything beginners need to know about
  classes and objects in Python[11]

- **[Python's Official Tutorial: Classes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)** - Refined documentation on
  Python's OOP implementation from Python.org[10]

#### Practice Platforms

  optional mentoring from experienced
  programmers[5]

- **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/)** - Popular platform with algorithm challenges and interview questions
  that can be solved in Python[5]

#### Design Patterns & Advanced Concepts

- **[Python-Patterns Repository](https://github.com/faif/python-patterns)** - GitHub collection of common OOP design
  patterns implemented in Python[10]

- **[Python Design Patterns](https://www.toptal.com/python/python-design-patterns)** - Tutorial explaining how classic
  design patterns are implemented in Python, often more
  simply than in Java[10]

- **[DataCamp's Python OOP Tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/python-oop-tutorial)** - Explains OOP concepts
  with practical examples including a finance application
  case study[2]

These resources focus on bridging the gap between Java and Python, emphasizing the differences in OOP implementation
while building on existing programming knowledge.
